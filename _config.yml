description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Technical problem solver extraordinaire who believes the most
  effective debugging tool is still careful thought...but a well-placed
  print statement never hurt. Specializing in MacOS forensics,
  code modernization, and explaining to people why turning it off
  and on again actually does work.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://jdhunterae.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
