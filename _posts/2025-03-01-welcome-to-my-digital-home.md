## Hello there

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm Andrew (Bard), and this site serves as the central hub for all my digital endeavors--a place where code, creativity, and technical musings converge.

### What You'll Find Here

This site is essentially a digital campfire where I gather my various passions:

**Technical Projects**--From digital forensics tools for macOS to system modernization efforts, I'll be documenting my coding adventures and sharing insights from the trenches of software development. I believe in breaking down complex technical challenges into manageable solutions, and I hope my project write-ups reflect that approach.

**Technical Writing**--As someone who's spent considerable time translating technical concepts into understandable documentation, I'll be sharing guides, explorations of interesting technical concepts, and the occasional deep dive into niche topics like Mac timestamps (spoiler: they're more fascinating than they sound).

**Creative Writing**--While ones and zeros dominate my professional life, words and stories occupy an equally important space in my mind. I'll occasionally share creative writing that has nothing to do with code—because developers contain multitudes.

**Ongoing Learning**--Technology never stands still, and neither does my learning. I'll document new skills I'm acquiring, interesting problems I'm tackling, and insights from my journey of continuous improvement.

### Why a Blog?

In our era of disposable social media posts and ephemeral content, I wanted a space that's more intentional--somewhere to develop ideas beyond character limits and algorithm-friendly formats. This blog gives me the freedom to explore topics with the depth they deserve.

Plus, articulating my thoughts helps me clarify my own thinking. As the programming adage goes: if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

### What's Next?

You can expect an eclectic mix of content in the coming months:

- Project showcases and technical deep-dives
- Reflections on tools and methodologies
- Occasional forays into creative territories
- Resources I've found helpful in my own journey

I'm looking forward to sharing this space with you. Feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jdhunterae) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/andrew-pomerleau) if anything resonates with you.

Thanks for stopping by!
